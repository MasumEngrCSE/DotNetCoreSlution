#region Single Responsibility Principle 

/*
 To implement the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) in C#, you should ensure that each class has only one reason to change.
 This means that a class should have only one responsibility or job. Here's an example of how you can implement SRP in C#:

 Let's say you have a class called Employee that currently handles both employee data management and reporting.
 To apply SRP, you should split this class into two separate classes: one for employee data management and another for reporting.
 
 Here's a basic example:

namespace ConsoleApp1.SOLID_principles
{

    // EmployeeDataManagement.cs
    public class EmployeeDataManagement
    {
        public void AddEmployee(Employee employee)
        {
            // Code to add an employee to the database
        }

        public void UpdateEmployee(Employee employee)
        {
            // Code to update an employee in the database
        }

        public void DeleteEmployee(Employee employee)
        {
            // Code to delete an employee from the database
        }
    }

    // EmployeeReportGenerator.cs
    public class EmployeeReportGenerator
    {
        public void GenerateEmployeeReport(Employee employee)
        {
            // Code to generate an employee report
        }
    }


    public class Employee
    {
        public Employee() { }
    }

}


#region Advantages


/*
 
Implementing the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) in C# and adhering to it provides several advantages:

Improved Code Maintainability: When each class has a single responsibility, it becomes easier to understand, modify, and maintain the codebase. Changes related to one responsibility won't affect other unrelated parts of the code, reducing the risk of introducing bugs during maintenance.

Enhanced Code Reusability: Classes with single responsibilities are often more reusable. You can use them in different parts of your application or even in other projects because they are narrowly focused on one task.

Easier Debugging: Debugging becomes more straightforward when a class has a single responsibility. You can isolate and test specific functionality without dealing with the complexities of unrelated code. This makes it easier to identify and fix issues.

Simpler Testing: Unit testing is more manageable when classes have single responsibilities. You can write focused unit tests for each class, ensuring that the individual components of your application work correctly in isolation.

Reduced Risk of Side Effects: With SRP, changes to one part of the code are less likely to unintentionally affect other parts. This reduces the risk of introducing unexpected side effects or breaking existing functionality when making modifications.

Easier Collaboration: When multiple developers work on a project, adhering to SRP makes it easier to divide and conquer tasks. Each developer can work on a specific class or module, knowing that changes won't disrupt unrelated parts of the codebase.

Flexibility and Extensibility: SRP promotes loose coupling between classes. This means you can extend your application by adding new classes or modules without having to modify existing code. You can follow the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) more easily, as new functionality can be added without altering existing classes.

Better Code Documentation: When classes have single responsibilities, their purpose and functionality are often more evident. This leads to better self-documenting code, making it easier for developers (including your future self) to understand how the code works.

Easier Code Reviews: Code reviews are more efficient when classes adhere to SRP because reviewers can focus on specific aspects of the code, ensuring that each class does what it's supposed to do without getting distracted by unrelated concerns.

Improved Scalability: As your application grows, following SRP ensures that it remains manageable. You can introduce new classes to handle additional responsibilities, and the existing codebase remains clean and organized.

In summary, implementing the Single Responsibility Principle in C# results in cleaner, more maintainable, and flexible code that is easier to work with and less prone to issues. It contributes to overall code quality and helps build robust and scalable software systems.

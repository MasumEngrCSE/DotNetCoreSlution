#region Facade Pattern

/*
 
The Facade Pattern is a structural pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem or set of interfaces.
This pattern is useful when you want to hide the complexities of a system and provide a unified interface for clients.

Here's an example of the Facade Pattern:

Suppose we're building a computer system, and there are various complex components like the CPU, RAM, and hard drive.
We can create a ComputerFacade that provides a simplified interface for turning on and off the computer.

#region In this example

/*
 
In this example, we have subsystem components like CPU, RAM, and HardDrive, each with their specific methods. The ComputerFacade class encapsulates the initialization and shutdown process of the computer, providing a simple interface to clients.

Now, let's see how you can use the ComputerFacade:


class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        ComputerFacade computer = new ComputerFacade();

        // Starting the computer
        computer.Start();

        Console.WriteLine("\nWorking on computer...\n");

        // Shutting down the computer
        computer.Shutdown();
    }
}

#region Why Facade Pattern is Necessary:

/*
 Why Facade Pattern is Necessary:

Simplified Interface: The Facade Pattern is necessary when you want to provide a simplified and unified interface to a complex subsystem. It shields clients from the details of the subsystem.

Complexity Hiding: It hides the complexity of a system, making it easier for clients to interact with it without needing to know the inner workings.

Decoupling: It promotes loose coupling between clients and subsystems. Changes in the subsystem can be isolated within the facade.

Encapsulation: The pattern encapsulates the initialization, configuration, or interaction with subsystem components in a single place.

Improved Maintainability: Facades make the codebase more maintainable by reducing the dependencies between clients and subsystems.

Consistency: It ensures that clients use the subsystem in a consistent manner, preventing potential misuse.

In summary, the Facade Pattern is necessary when you want to simplify the interaction with a complex system or subsystem by 
providing a unified and easy-to-use interface. It promotes encapsulation, decoupling, and code maintainability while shielding clients from the complexities of the underlying system.
